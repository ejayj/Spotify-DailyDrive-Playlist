Issues I ran into with deploymnet:
1 - Pip has to be upgraded to the latest version
2 - Python has to be upgraded to the latest version
3 - I may have to use '&&' commands for specific requirments that won't install, in order to get the build working
4 - known pip install errors with deprecated pip and python versions (mainly python) are: dnspython, flask, and flask-sql alchemy
